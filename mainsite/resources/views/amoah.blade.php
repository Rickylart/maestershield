            Is a name of an indigenous armpit talking drum which has its origins traced all the way back to the Ghana Empire and which was located in Western part of the African continent.
            Prior it's usage, it was believed to have first been designed by a young drummer who had gotten the inspiration of making a two headed drums, sealed by animal skin and
            connected to each other with stretched cords joining the two heads and pulling them tightly to impress his younger brother, with the two heads being beaten.
          </p>
          <p class="font-italic">
            These significant drum design kept changing the tones when placed in the armpit and played whiles ones arm thus tightening
             and losing the connecting cords joining the two drum heads. Surprisingly, the tones thus produced sounded very much like their spoken language
             and they realized that messages that could be  easily understood could be passed on to each other by in which the drums was played. Soon afterwards therefore,
             many more of these drums where produced and came into common usage by being incorporated into their music making. Following the fall of the Ghana Empire, and
             European colonization of Wast Africa, some of the West African countries adopted and continue to use the Dondo drums for several purposes, such as the transmission of  messages;
            during the performance of various customary rites; during Durbars; funerals;  marriages; etc
          </p>
          <p class="font-italic">
            In Ghana today,the Dondo talking drums,are still been made and are mostly finished by adorning them with the Kente or Fugu cloths.
